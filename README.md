# UVA SOLUTION

My solutions to the UVA problems that I have solved successfully. I have created all of the code myself.

I have completed my B.Sc Hons in CSE from DIU.

These are usually not the most optimal solutions, but they all are accepted within the given time limit.

My UVA account is sajal_khan (http://uhunt.felix-halim.net/id/574150)
